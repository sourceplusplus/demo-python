## What is this?

This project holds Node.js-based feature demonstrations for [Source++](https://github.com/sourceplusplus/sourceplusplus),
the open-source live coding platform. These demonstrations are meant to be used as a reference for how to use Source++
in your own projects.

## How to use?

Install the Source++ plugin via the JetBrains Marketplace by searching for: `Source++`.
Alternatively, you can download the Source++ plugin directly from [here](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12033-source-).

Once the plugin is installed, check out the demos below. Each demo contains instructions explaining how to use it.

> Note: You do not need to run this code to play with the demos. This application is hosted on our publicly accessible servers.

## Demos

### [Add Breakpoint](./src/command/AddBreakpoint.py)

This demonstration shows how to add a "non-breaking breakpoint" to a running application. The **Add Breakpoint** command
is useful for debugging production applications without impacting the end user.

For more information, see the [AddBreakpoint](./src/command/AddBreakpoint.py) class.
